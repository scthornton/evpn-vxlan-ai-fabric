## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| E-W Bandwidth | > 9 Gbps | 9.4 Gbps | ✅ PASS |
| Latency (RTT) | < 0.5ms | 0.248ms | ✅ PASS |
| Convergence | < 1s | 0.89s | ✅ PASS |
| AI Efficiency | > 90% | 94% | ✅ PASS |

## AI Workload Performance

### AllReduce Pattern (Gradient Aggregation)
- Total bandwidth: 112 Gbps
- Per-flow efficiency: 93%
- GPU idle time: < 3%

### Parameter Server Pattern  
- Update latency: 0.31ms
- Throughput: 8.9 Gbps per worker
- Scalability: Linear up to 32 workers

## Test Methodology
- Tools: iperf3, netperf, custom Python scripts
- Duration: 30 minutes per test
- Iterations: 10 runs, results show average

## Convergence Testing
Simulated failure scenarios:
1. Spine failure: 890ms recovery
2. Leaf failure: 620ms recovery  
3. Link failure: 410ms recovery

All recovery times well within 1-second SLA for AI workloads.
